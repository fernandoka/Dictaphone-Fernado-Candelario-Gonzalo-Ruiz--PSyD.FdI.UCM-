The last proyect we had made in "Programación de Sistemas y Dispositivos". This system record the sounds using a microphone and store them in memory (there is a max number of bytes to store, depending of the board). As much you can record 4 diferents "songs" (this dosen´t depends of the board, we had decided to set a limit). With the sounds you had recorded, you con play them and do some changes of how the "song" sounds, for example you can heard the "inverse song". 
You can see how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozE266m1ho
